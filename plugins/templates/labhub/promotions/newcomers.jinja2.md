Welcome @{{ target }}! :tada:

We've just sent you an invite via email. Please accept it before proceeding forward.

To get started, please follow our [newcomers guide](https://coala.io/newcomer). Most issues will be explained there and in linked pages - it will save you a lot of time, just read it. *Really.*

*Do not take an issue if you don't understand it on your own.* Especially if you are new you have to be aware that getting started with an open source community is not trivial: you will have to work hard and most likely become a better coder than you are now just as we all did.

Don't get us wrong: we are *very* glad to have you with us on this journey into open source! We will also be there for you at all times to help you with actual problems. :)
